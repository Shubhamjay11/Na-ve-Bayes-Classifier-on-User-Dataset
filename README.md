# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-on-User-Dataset
Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.

## Introduction

Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.
It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
Some popular examples of Naïve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.

## Advantages of Naïve Bayes Classifier

Naïve Bayes is one of the fast and easy ML algorithms to predict a class of datasets.
It can be used for Binary as well as Multi-class Classifications.
It performs well in Multi-class predictions as compared to the other Algorithms.
It is the most popular choice for text classification problems.

## Disadvantages of Naïve Bayes Classifier:

Naive Bayes assumes that all features are independent or unrelated, so it cannot learn the relationship between features.
